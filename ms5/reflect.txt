In this project, I have to say I learnt alot. Especially, coming from
IPC144 project this project is like a whole new world. In this term, 
project and workshops included, I have learnt new object-oriented terms
and principles. such as, polymorphism, class, constructor, and so on.
Everything needs to be encapsulated, somethings that is teach in IPC 
is not used because of security issue. C++ is more memory safe. there 
are alot of way to use operator. 

The most challenging thing in this project is formatting output. I 
think it is the most tedious and annoying thing when there is missing
character, space, or a new line character. Everything else is 
challenging enough for a project. not too hard and not too easy.
